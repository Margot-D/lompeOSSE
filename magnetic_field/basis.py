    Attributes
    ----------
    short_name : str
        Short identifier for the basis.
    index_names : list of str
        Names of the indices used in the basis representation.
    index_length : int
        Total number of basis functions.
    index_arrays : list of array-like
        Arrays containing the indices used in the basis.
    minimum_phi_sampling : float
        Minimum required sampling points in phi direction.
    caching : bool
        Whether basis evaluations can be cached.

    Notes
    -----
    Subclasses must implement all abstract methods and properties.
